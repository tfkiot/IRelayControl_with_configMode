# IRelayControl_with_configMode
IR Relay Controller is an Arduino-based system that controls up to 4 relays via an IR remote. It saves relay states and IR codes in EEPROM for persistence. A config mode allows programming new IR codes using a button or a special IR signal. Built-in LED provides feedback. Ideal for home automation and remote-controlled relay applications. ðŸš€
